Another exciting terraform project over here! This was an intense task in my Cloud/Terraform journey I’ve now been able to implement another solution created on Terraform using AWS. Here, I first had to specify the AWS Provider configuration to fine-tune the crucial needs for specifying which region and version of Terraform to use. The modular structure of the Terraform code, organized into distinct files for variables, network, web servers, database, and providers, enhances clarity and maintainability.
I established a networking for this project, beginning with a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to isolate my resources and equipped with two strategically placed subnets—one public and one private—spread across different availability zones in AWS.

The public subnet designed here benefits from direct internet access through an Internet Gateway, while the private subnet relies on a NAT Gateway for secure internet connectivity. Security groups have been carefully configured to control inbound and outbound traffic, ensuring a robust yet flexible environment.
To enhance this even further and meet application scaling demands, I've implemented a Load Balancer and Web Server setup. This involves two web servers deployed across the public subnets, which are managed by an Application Load Balancer (ALB). The ALB efficiently manages the traffic flow to the web servers, ensuring high availability and reliability for the application.
Additionally, I've configured a database subnet group to host an Amazon RDS instance, ensuring that the database resides in the private subnets for added security. The RDS instance is designed for high availability and performance, leveraging Multi-AZ deployment.
This Terraform project offers a robust, scalable, and highly available infrastructure in AWS.

By dividing the project into modules and focusing on key components like VPC, subnets, security groups, web servers, load balancer, and database, the Terraform configuration achieves a structured, maintainable, and scalable infrastructure setup on AWS.
